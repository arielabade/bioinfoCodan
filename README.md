The input is a file of transcripts in the fasta format, with the argument of the model which you wannt to annalyze

If you want to analyze "homo sapiens" you need to upload the vertebrate model in order to make CodAn work the way it should

Here is a brief tutorial on how to get access to thousand of fasta file:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLcmEqBayr0

- [ ] We need to find how to save the analysis from CodAn in one folder to evaluate the machine learning models in the future. Usually the output gets stored in the "output" folder but as soon as we run another test, the previous one is erased. It would be nice to fix that
- [ ] Try to solve the github error that does not allow me to publish my changes in the CodAnn folder
